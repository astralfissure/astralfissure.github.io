<h1>Prologue One</h1>
<h2>Unknowing.</h2>
<img class=epimg src=page1.png alt="Fern lies in bed. A sticky note with a drawing of an oval figure can be seen on a night stand, where an alarm clock also resides. | The alarm clock is seen from the front, the time is 6:59 AM. | The alarm clock switches to 7:00 AM, and begins beeping."><br>
<img class=epimg src=page2.png alt="Fern wakes up to the sound of the beeping and looks shocked. | Fern sits on their bed, their 'tail' wagging. They think, 'It, that dream, it wasn't. | The scene cuts to their dream, where they are standing in the forest; one of their eyes is red, and they look scared. | A figure stares at them from a white backdrop. The figure is in the same oval shape as the drawing on the sticky note, and is pitch-black with blank white eyes and no mouth."><br>
<img class=epimg src=page3.png alt="Another scene is seen from the dream, which is all monochrome. Fern is sitting, upset, while the character from their dreams puts its hands on his shoulders. | Fern thinks, 'It wasn't real'. | Fern walks to work. He thinks, 'was it?' | Fern sits at a desk and thinks, 'Of course not.' | The scene cuts to black and they think 'It was just a dream.'"><br>
<img class=epimg src=page4.png alt="Fern logs onto his work computer. Sticky notes can be seen on either side of the monitor which read 'You owe me - B.R.' and 'DO WORK'. The computer is loading, and Fern thinks 'Even still'. | The computer loads to an internet browser, with a search engine called 'Internet' pulled up, with a beige background. Fern thinks 'I can't help.' | Fern opens an employee database. The beige is now grey, to show that Fern is half dreaming. They think, 'but think.' | The scene cuts to black. Fern thinks 'Somehow, somewhere."><br>
<img class=epimg src=page5.png alt="Text at the top reads 'Glass Oval Stone - 99,462.' The text is black on a white background, to show that Fern is entirely dreaming it. The white fades to beige, then to black. A white outline of the figure, body filled in with black, is shown in front of the black."><br><br>
