<img class=epimg src=page1.png alt="Someone yells to Fern while they look scared and sit in the fetal position, in a hallucination. | Beetroot is scene telling Fern 'It's time to go.' Beetroot is the only part of the scene that isn't hallucinated. | Beetroot says 'I left you some coffee.' | Fern sits in a hallucination and says 'Th-thanks.' | Fern hallucinates Beetroot as the mysterious figure from Prologue One as they say 'I hope you get better soon...' | Fern looks scared and says 'Oh! Thanks.' | Later, they're seen running into a hallucination through a door. "><br>
<img class=epimg src=page2.png alt="Fern stands in a hallucination and thinks 'It's not real. It's not- I'm-'. | Fern yells 'STOP! GET AWAY!' as they're surrounded by the mysterious figures, now with outlined eyes and white bodies. | The panel is pitch black. Fern yells 'YOU'RE NOT REAL!' | Fern sits in the fetal position and starts screaming and crying. The figures no longer appear, but a sticky note from Epilogue One with a drawing of one falls in front of him."><br>
<img class=epimg src=page3.png alt="Fern closes their eyes and continues screaming and crying. The panel is entirely black and white. | A large amount of lightning shoots out from where Fern was, and they are now gone. The screaming is shown being sucked into the center of the lightning. | The lightning fades, as does the screaming. | A black cloud in a cloudy daytime sky is seen with black and white lightning shooting from it."><br>
<img class=epimg src=page4.png alt="The white lightning grows larger as Fern falls out of the lightning and continues screaming. A white oval stone and a grey journal with a red strap look toward them."><br><br>
