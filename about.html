<h1>About</h1>
<p style='max-width:900;'>Astral Fissure is a webcomic about a giant gash in the sky and the various consequences and reasons for it. The comic first came into being in September 2023, before beginning in February 2024. The comic was inspired by Pok√©mon: Legends Arceus, object shows (specifically comics such as <a href='https://objectifiedcomic.com'>Objectified</a> and <a href='https://fourfullmoons.com'>The Four Moons initiative</a>, though few elements are taken from them compared to Battle for Dream Island, for example), among other sources.<br> While this comic does not feature many direct horror elements, instead aiming for action-based and psychological horror, some may find certain parts of the comic make them uncomfortable. Examples include depictions of panic attacks and large spiders. For this reason, content warnings have been placed on all episodes which feature possibly disturbing content, and synopsis (with and without mentions of the possibly disturbing content) are available at /episodes/synopsis and /episodes/synopsis-safe.</p><br>
